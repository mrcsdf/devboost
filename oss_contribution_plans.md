# 🛠️ OSS Contribution Paths for You

### ✅ **1. Join a Security-First DevOps Project**

These align with your Zero Trust + automation expertise:

* **[Sigstore](https://github.com/sigstore)** – Secure supply chain tools (signing, verifying container builds).
* **[Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa)** – Cloud-native policy enforcement.
* **[Falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco)** – Runtime security for containers.
* **[Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)** – Vulnerability scanner you could extend or harden.

🔹 *Easy start*: Open an issue, propose a security-related enhancement, or improve CI/CD logic.

---

### 🧠 **2. Help Hardening AI Tools and Infra**

You're building LLM pipelines—plenty of OSS projects could use your security brain.

* **[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)** or **[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)** – Suggest/implement secure input validation, RBAC/Zero Trust features, or better deployment stories.
* **[MLflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow)** – Help with secure deployment/monitoring pipelines.
* **[FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)** – Well-loved framework used in AI serving.

🔹 *Easy start*: Improve Docker security, submit PRs to clarify cloud deployment instructions.

---

### 🔁 **3. Container Ecosystem**

You already use Compose and Docker heavily.

* **[Hotio](https://github.com/hotio)** – Since you use their containers, contribute fixes or feature ideas (VPN integration, healthchecks, docs).
* **[LinuxServer.io](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-templates)** – Tweak or submit configs you’ve hardened.
* **[Devcontainers](https://github.com/devcontainers/features)** – Create or refine features (e.g., secure shell, ZTA templates).

🔹 *Easy start*: Make your own devcontainer and submit it as a `feature` or `template`.

---

### 📘 **4. Focused Contribution Ideas (No Code Required to Start)**

* Write security-focused setup guides for **zero trust containers** or **LLM ops**.
* Create **sample Terraform + Bash stacks** for deploying secure AI clusters.
* Review or contribute to **docs or examples** for `mise`, `Devcontainers`, or even `k3s`.

---

## 🚀 First-Time OSS Strategy

### 🔍 Step 1: Pick 1 repo you already use

Maybe `Trivy`, `LangGraph`, or `Devcontainers`.

### ✍️ Step 2: Do a 15-minute audit

* Are examples outdated?
* Is there missing secure config (like disabling password logins)?
* Is there a weird workaround you had to do?

Open an issue or suggest a doc improvement.

### 🧪 Step 3: Make it repeatable

Turn your improvement into a GitHub Actions snippet, shell script, or doc PR.

---

If you want, I can:

* Generate a personalized issue + PR template.
* Set up your GitHub fork workflow with Devcontainers + secure GitHub tokens.
* Or help you write your **first contribution commit message + PR body**.

Would you like to pick a project now and I’ll help guide that first step?
